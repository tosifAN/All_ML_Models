# Bagging in Machine Learning

## Introduction
Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble learning technique designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of machine learning models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, bagging reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting.

## Key Features
- **Bootstrapping:** Involves creating multiple subsets of the training dataset by randomly sampling with replacement. Each subset, known as a "bootstrap sample," is used to train a separate model.
- **Aggregation:** The predictions of all models are combined to produce a final output. For classification tasks, this is typically done by majority voting, while for regression tasks, the average of the predictions is used.
- **Parallel Training:** Each model in the ensemble is trained independently, allowing for parallel processing and reducing training time.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Overfitting:** Averaging the predictions of multiple models mitigates the risk of overfitting compared to a single model.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Bagging often leads to better predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.
- **Robustness:** The ensemble approach makes the final model more robust to variations and noise in the data.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preparation:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Bootstrapping:** Generate multiple bootstrap samples from the training set.
3. **Model Training:** Train a separate model on each bootstrap sample.
4. **Prediction Aggregation:** Combine the predictions from all models to make the final prediction.
