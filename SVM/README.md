# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks in machine learning. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. 

## Introduction
Support Vector Machines are used to find a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into different classes. The key idea behind SVM is to find the margin that maximizes the distance between data points of different classes. SVM can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

## Key Features
- **Margin Maximization:** SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes, ensuring the margin between the classes is as wide as possible.
- **Kernel Trick:** SVM can use different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF) to transform the data into a higher dimensional space where a hyperplane can be used to separate the classes.
- **Support Vectors:** These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. Only the support vectors are relevant in defining the hyperplane, which makes the SVM efficient.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the data by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training:** Train the SVM model using the training data. Choose an appropriate kernel and tune hyperparameters such as C (regularization parameter) and gamma (kernel coefficient for RBF).
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its performance.
