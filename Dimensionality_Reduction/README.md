# Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization Techniques

Welcome to the Dimensionality Reduction repository! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques including PCA, LDA, FA, ICA, NMF, and t-SNE.

## Introduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques are crucial in machine learning and data analysis for simplifying datasets, reducing computational costs, and enhancing visualization. This repository provides implementations of several key techniques:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Factor Analysis (FA)**
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**

These methods help in reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible, and can be useful for improving the performance of machine learning models.

## Techniques Covered

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a statistical technique used to identify the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction.

### 2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that focuses on maximizing the separation between different classes in the dataset.

### 3. Factor Analysis (FA)

FA is used to model the underlying relationships between variables by assuming that observed variables are influenced by latent factors.

### 4. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

ICA is a technique used to separate a multivariate signal into additive, independent components. It is useful for applications like source separation.

### 5. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

NMF is a technique used to factorize a matrix into two non-negative matrices. It is often used in text mining and image processing.

### 6. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
