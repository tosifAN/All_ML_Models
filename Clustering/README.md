# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning

Welcome to the Clustering Algorithms repository! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of various clustering algorithms including KMeans, MeanShift, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

## Introduction

Clustering is a powerful machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. This repository provides implementations of three popular clustering algorithms:

- **KMeans Clustering**
- **MeanShift Clustering**
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering**

These algorithms are commonly used in various applications such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and pattern recognition.

## Algorithms Covered

### 1. KMeans Clustering

KMeans is a partitioning method that divides data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

### 2. MeanShift Clustering

MeanShift is a non-parametric clustering technique that does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. It identifies clusters by finding modes in the data density.

### 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering

GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to find the parameters of these distributions.
