# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning

Welcome to the Clustering Algorithms repository! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of various clustering algorithms including KMeans, MeanShift, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.

## Introduction

Clustering is a powerful machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. This repository provides implementations of five popular clustering algorithms:

- **KMeans Clustering**
- **MeanShift Clustering**
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- **Agglomerative Clustering**

These algorithms are commonly used in various applications such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and pattern recognition.

## Algorithms Covered

### 1. KMeans Clustering

KMeans is a partitioning method that divides data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

### 2. MeanShift Clustering

MeanShift is a non-parametric clustering technique that does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. It identifies clusters by finding modes in the data density.

### 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering

GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to find the parameters of these distributions.

### 4. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes and can handle noise in the data. It does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.

### 5. Agglomerative Clustering

Agglomerative Clustering is a hierarchical clustering method that builds nested clusters by successively merging or splitting them. It creates a tree-like structure called a dendrogram to represent the data.
