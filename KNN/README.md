# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks in machine learning. KNN is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression.

## Introduction
K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. In KNN, the classification of a data point is determined by the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. It is based on the assumption that similar data points exist in close proximity.

## Key Features
- **Simplicity:** KNN is straightforward to understand and implement, making it an excellent choice for beginners in machine learning.
- **No Training Phase:** Unlike other algorithms, KNN does not have an explicit training phase. The model is built directly from the dataset.
- **Distance Metrics:** KNN uses distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) to measure the similarity between data points.
- **Hyperparameter k:** The choice of k, the number of neighbors, significantly affects the performance of the algorithm. A small value of k can be noisy and susceptible to outliers, while a large value makes the algorithm computationally expensive.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the data by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training:** There is no explicit training phase. Instead, the model stores the training dataset.
3. **Prediction:** For a new data point, calculate the distance to all training data points, find the k nearest neighbors, and determine the majority class.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its performance.
