## ✅ Completed Models
- Simple Regression(Linear) ([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)) - Predicts a continuous outcome based on a single feature.
- Multiple Regression ([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)) - Predicts a continuous outcome based on multiple features.
- Polynomial Regression ([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)) - Captures non-linear relationships between features and the outcome.
- Ridge Regression([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)): Addresses overfitting by introducing L2 regularization to the linear regression model.
- Lasso Regression([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)): Performs feature selection and regularization by adding L1 penalty to the linear regression model.
- Elastic Net Regression([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)): Combines the strengths of Ridge and Lasso regression by using both L1 and L2 penalties.
- Logistic Regression([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Regression)): Predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam).
- Decision Trees([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/DecisionTree)): Creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
- Random Forest([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Bagging)): An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Bosting)): An ensemble method that builds models sequentially, where each model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model.
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/Bosting)): Efficient and scalable implementations of gradient boosting with various optimizations.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/SVM)): Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)([Link to Folder](https://github.com/tosifAN/All_ML_Models/tree/main/KNN)): Classifies new data points based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.
