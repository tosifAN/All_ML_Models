## Introduction

Regression analysis is a powerful tool used in machine learning to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value(s) of one or more independent variables. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various regression techniques.

## Completed Models

1. **Simple Linear Regression**
    - Description: Simple linear regression is a method to predict a dependent variable (y) based on a single independent variable (x).
    - Status: Completed

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
    - Description: Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, where the dependent variable is predicted based on multiple independent variables.
    - Status: Completed

3. **Polynomial Regression**
    - Description: Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
    - Status: Completed

1. **Ridge Regression**
    - Description: Ridge regression is a technique used when data suffers from multicollinearity (independent variables are highly correlated). It adds a degree of bias to the regression estimates, reducing standard errors.
    - Status: Completed

2. **Lasso Regression**
    - Description: Lasso regression is similar to ridge regression but with L1 regularization. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a simpler model.
    - Status: Completed

3. **Elastic Net Regression**
    - Description: Elastic net regression combines the properties of both ridge and lasso regressions. It is useful when there are multiple features that are correlated with one another.
    - Status: Completed

4. **Robust Regression8**
    - Robust regression is a form of regression analysis designed to overcome some limitations of traditional parametric and non-parametric methods. Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process.
    - Status: Completed
