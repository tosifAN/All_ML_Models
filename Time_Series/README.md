## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of data analysis and is used in various domains such as finance, weather forecasting, and supply chain management. This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and comparing several popular time series forecasting models.

## Models Implemented

### ARIMA
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values, its own past errors, and other terms.

### SARIMA
Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) extends ARIMA by explicitly supporting univariate time series data with a seasonal component.

### Prophet
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is particularly good at handling missing data and large outliers.

### RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data such as time series.

### LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies, particularly well-suited for time series data.

### GRU
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of RNN that is similar to LSTM but has a simpler structure and is computationally more efficient.
